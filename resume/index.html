        <p>A marketer with a passion for all things digital, I am a natural born storyteller who thrives when given creative freedom. That paired with my detail-oriented eye bred a passion for developing data informed material that goes beyond the "what" and delivers the "why". As a self-starter who works across multiple teams, I use my entrepreneurial spirit to build processes from the ground up taking the initiative to develop dashboards which make data actionable, accessible, and digestible.</p>

        <p class="quote">"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go" - Dr. Suess</p>
        <p>In more recent years, I’ve utilized online resources such as <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> to deepen my knowledge of Data Analysis through the usage of SQL. Additionally, I've completed Interaction Design courses from<a href="http://www.trydesignlab.com"> DesignLab</a> and a Front-End Developer Blueprint from<a href="http://www.skillcrush.com"> Skillcrush</a>. In June 2019, I completed the Data Analytics: Techniques for Decision Making certificate program through the University of Washington where I learned fun things like predictive analytics using R! I love learning so when I'm not deriving insights from data or testing analytics implementation across multiple devices, you can usually find me on YouTube consuming content related to the tech and media industry.</p>
