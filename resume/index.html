				<p>Having spent the first 3 years of college studying for an accounting degree, I ultimately made the decision in my senior year to pursue marketing instead. As a natural born storyteller, I thrive when given creative freedom. Paired with my detail oriented eye, a passion for developing data informed material in the forms of Powerpoints, Excel Workbooks, and dashboards was born.</p>

				<p>Curiosity in tow, I've begun utilizing online resources to develop technical skills having just completed the Front-End Developer Blueprint through <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush.</a> Additionally, I am a 200 Hour Certified yoga teacher having completed my training at <a href="http://www.yogaworks.com">YogaWorks.</a>
